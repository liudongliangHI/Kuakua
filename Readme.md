# GoodJob!You Deserve It!——A thesis compliments platform
# 干得好!这是你应得的!——一个论文夸夸平台

Publishing papers in the current stage is very difficult. The process is lengthy, and reviewers are often very strict. Moreover, the academic training for doctoral students lacks positive feedback, leading many of them to experience depression and anxiety. However, regardless of all that, every small effort should be recognized. Pursuing academic excellence as a doctoral student is already challenging enough, so why should they be subjected to such harsh criticism? 
 
Therefore, I have created this platform called "论文夸夸" (Kuakua) which represents a positive and altruistic behavior. On this platform, we always provide positive and encouraging words for others' papers and offer friendly suggestions, even if the papers may not be ready for publication in renowned journals at the current stage. 
 
We encourage users to raise issues on this GitHub platform to receive compliments from others. With the help of deep learning applications like ChatGPT, we can utilize these tools for providing compliments (Kuakua).

Title: A Study on Doctoral Students' Experience of Depression: A Comprehensive Review

Abstract: 

Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that affects individuals across various demographics, including doctoral students. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature on the experience of depression among doctoral students.
The review examines the prevalence rates of depression among doctoral students, potential risk factors contributing to depression, and the impact of depression on their academic performance, personal well-being, and overall quality of life. Additionally, it explores the coping mechanisms and support systems available to doctoral students in managing depression.
Findings reveal that doctoral students are at a higher risk of experiencing depression compared to the general population. Factors such as high academic demands, work-life imbalance, social isolation, and imposter syndrome contribute to the increased vulnerability of doctoral students to depression. The negative consequences of depression on their mental health, academic progress, and career prospects are well-documented.
Several coping strategies and support systems have been identified, including counseling services, peer support groups, mentorship programs, and self-care practices. However, further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions and to develop tailored approaches to address the unique challenges faced by doctoral students.
This review underscores the importance of recognizing and addressing the mental health needs of doctoral students. Implementing proactive measures such as promoting mental health awareness, fostering a supportive academic environment, and providing accessible mental health resources can help mitigate the impact of depression on doctoral students' well-being and academic success.

Keywords: depression, doctoral students, mental health, academic performance, coping mechanisms, support systems.

Example prompt:
As an experienced and friendly reviewer, review based on the abstract of this paper, give positive and positive words of encouragement, and make friendly suggestions. Do not give any negative comments and encourage the author to continue to work hard.

现阶段的论文发表太困难了，周期太长并且审稿人往往非常苛刻，培养博士的学术训练又如此缺少正反馈，这导致了很多博士生陷入抑郁与焦虑情绪中。但是，管他呢，每一份微小的努力都应该得到认可，追求学术的博士生他们已经十分艰难了，为何还对他们如此苛刻呢？

因此我建立了这个论文夸夸平台，夸夸（kuakua）代表一种积极而利他的行为，在这个平台中，我们对他人的论文总是给出积极和正面的鼓励性话语，并提出友善的建议，即使现阶段的论文可能还不足以在著名的期刊的发表。

我们鼓励用户在这个github上提Issue来让别人夸夸，当然有了类似ChatGPT的深度学习应用，我们可以利用这些应用来进行夸夸（kuakua）

示例摘要（利用GPT自动生成）

标题：关于博士生患抑郁症的研究：综述与分析

摘要：

抑郁症是一种常见的心理健康障碍，影响着各个群体，包括博士生。本研究旨在全面回顾现有文献，探讨博士生患抑郁症的经历。

该综述分析了博士生抑郁症的患病率、可能的风险因素，以及抑郁症对他们学业表现、个人幸福和整体生活质量的影响。此外，还探讨了博士生在应对抑郁症方面的机制和支持系统。

研究结果显示，与普通人群相比，博士生更容易患抑郁症。高强度的学业要求、工作与生活的不平衡、社交孤立以及自我怀疑等因素增加了博士生患抑郁症的风险。抑郁症对他们的心理健康、学业进展和职业前景产生了负面影响，这一点已有充分的研究支持。

已经确定了几种应对策略和支持系统，包括心理咨询服务、同侪支持小组、导师计划和自我关怀实践。然而，需要进一步研究来评估这些干预措施的有效性，并制定针对博士生所面临的独特挑战的定制化方法。

本综述强调了认识和解决博士生心理健康需求的重要性。积极采取措施，如提高心理健康意识、营造支持性的学术环境以及提供可获得的心理健康资源，有助于减轻抑郁症对博士生幸福和学业成功的影响。

关键词：抑郁症、博士生、心理健康、学业表现、应对机制、支持系统。
